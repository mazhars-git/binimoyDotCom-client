# Binimoy Frontend

## üìñ Project Overview

**Binimoy** is a modern gadget buy & sell platform that provides a seamless user experience for browsing, listing, and managing gadgets for sale. This frontend project is built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, ensuring fast performance and maintainable code. With features like **JWT-based authentication**, **role-based dashboards**, **secure form handling**, and a **themed UI**, it offers a scalable and user-centric interface.

The application supports two types of users: **Admins** and **Regular Users**. Admins can manage products, users, and transactions, while users can list gadgets, manage their listings, and interact securely with the platform.

The UI is crafted using **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI**, offering both aesthetic flexibility and accessibility. All interactions and state management are handled efficiently with **Redux Toolkit**, and the app ensures data validation and security with **zod** and **Google reCAPTCHA** integration.

Whether you're buying, selling, or managing gadget deals‚Äî**Adolbodol** offers a smooth, responsive, and secure experience.
